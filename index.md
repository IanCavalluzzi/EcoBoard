This is the start of the [ecoboard.live](ecoboard.live) documentation. I'm going to be writing up everything I've found out during the process of incorporating wheat paste into Cardboard MDF.

## Apologies for any missing information or topics, the website is still in early development.

## Overview
   - Cardboard Medium Density Fibreboard (MDF) is a cost-effective material used in large-scale applications like construction but remains largely untapped for smaller products.
   - Cardboard MDF is rarely used in smaller-scale manufacturing because of the binder, Urea-Formaldehyde which is used in large-scale manufacturing that's toxic and difficult to work with.
   - On a smaller business scale, cardboard MDF is manufactured with environmentally harmful binders such as Polyvinyl Acetate (PVA).
### xyzaiden
   - In 2021, Aiden Leitch discovered that cardboard could be blended with Polyvinyl Acetate (PVA) and pressed in a 3D-Printed mold to create any cardboard MDF package or item, of any thickness.
   - PVA is environmentally harmful, so Leitchâ€™s research attempted to expand and use rice paste and cornstarch as binders but had negative results as the strength of the MDF was low.
   - This process can make Cardboard MDF molding accessible, but there weren't any known human and environmentally-friendly binders that work for MDF.

### Why Wheat Paste
- Wheat paste is made purely from water and flour, combined in a cold/hot mixture.
- In my testing wheat paste was cheaper, environmentally friendly, and just as strong as PVA.
- Overall it's a better replacement when making Cardboard MDF.
